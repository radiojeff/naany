  <b>Notes:</b><br>
  The required fields for this tool per ADIF file are listed below.
  <ul>
   <li>EOH - The header of the ADIF is separated from the records. The
  software doesn't technically need this record, but it is by default part
 of all ADIF files, so the software relies on finding this token before 
evaluating any QSO record.</li>
   <li>QSO_DATE - Required, obviously to check the date of each QSO record
against the specified year you entered for the NAANY award calculation.</li>
   <li>DXCC - Required. The logging software must insert a field for the <b>numeric</b>
identity of the DXCC entity.  Most logging programs do this.  Without the DXCC
numeric valie per record, the software cannot feasibly reverse lookup
the CALL to determnine the continent.  It could use the CALL field, but
that would make the tool extremely slow and unreliable since not all call signs are in databases.   Check your logging/conversion to ensure DXCC is present in each record.</li>
   <li>CALL - Required to figure out if the contact has the properties for NAANY entries.</li>
   <li> BAND - Required.  Technically the band has no influence on the
NAANY calculation, but this software requires it.</li>
   <li> EOR - End of Record field.  Required.  All ADIF records must have it. All Records are terminated with this field.  There is one EOR field per QSO record.
 </ul>
<p>
If your log is still generating zero results, then please send me the first 20 lines
of your ADIF file.  20 complete lines from the top of the file.  I'll debug it after you
send that sample.
<p>
ADIF is a peculiar format and sometimes the parsing routines get it wrong.  Your sample
can help me correct the bugs.
